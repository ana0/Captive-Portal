President-elect Donald Trump wants to build a wall.
  
The proposed wall will be along the Mexican-American border, a potential 3201 kilometer long monument to xenophobia, the military industrial complex, and fear.  What can art do in the face of power?  Perhaps nothing.  Nonetheless, as an installation for the CCA Captive Portal site I propose a response to this project, and an exploration of border barriers in general: “C.P. Customs and Border Protection Agency,” a digital simulated checkpoint and AR game.  

Visitors and potential wifi users will find themselves in a digital recreation of the proposed border wall.  They will search the space, easily finding an official-looking form from the Border Protection Agency.  But the form is long and tedious – the questions it asks are invasive.  There is no guarantee of being allowed through, perhaps the visitor will have to try again later.  They may never find out why. 
 
But all is not as it necessarily as it seems.  Hidden within the checkpoint are possibilities.  If the visitor is resourceful, they may find a way to bypass the checkpoint – or to leave a message for future visitors.  Hidden within the physical space of the gallery itself, will be small clues: Perhaps there is a password in the bathroom under the sink.  The border barrier turns out the be permeable.  Like the authoritarian ideology itself, it’s full of holes.
